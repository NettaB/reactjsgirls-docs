## Create a new Sandbox

We will start from scratch in CodeSandbox so let's start by creating a new React Sandbox and you can do this by clicking [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/new)

## The code

When creating a new Sandbox we get a `index.js` with the following code:

<Code code={`
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
\n
import "./styles.css";
\n
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
\n
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
`} />

Going piece by piece we first import React and React Dom. We need React for writing our application and react-dom to inject all our code in the DOM.
The DOM is what the browser gives us to write HTML and in these two lines:

<Code code={`
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
`} />

We are telling React Dom to get the HTML we generated in our function and attach it to the DOM so we can see it in our page.

## Changes to the template

In React there two main type of components, the type this page has is a statless component. This means it only returns [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and does no changes to data inside of it.

In our case we need to a lot of stuff in our component so we need a class component because this will allow us to change data and also store some values inside the component.

To turn it into a class component we need to first import `Component` from React and we do it like this:

<Code code={`import React, { Component } from 'react'`} />

> If you are not used to this syntax this means we are importing what the react package exports by default and also another function it gives us access to.

#### Let's now transform our Component:

In class components there is only one required method and that is the render method. This is where we tell react what we want to put in the DOM.

Knowing this we end up with this:

<Code code={`
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
        <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
`} />

There are not a lot of changes for now but this will allows us to continue making our component better and better.
